  # Backups: restic for /home
  ################################
  #
  # The system is reproducible from this flake; /home/austin is not. This job
  # backs it up daily to a restic repository.
  #
  # ONE-TIME SETUP: run `backup-setup` (defined below). It creates the
  # repository password in /etc/secrets/restic-password (keep a copy OFF this
  # machine; losing it makes the backups unreadable forever), formats a USB
  # drive partition as ext4 labelled BACKUP, mounts it at /mnt/backup, and
  # runs the first backup. Until then the job skips silently.
  #
  # For a remote target instead, change `repository` to e.g.
  # "sftp:austin@myserver:/srv/restic-shitbox" and remove the
  # ConditionPathIsMountPoint line.
  #
  # Check and restore (as root; the password file is root-only):
  #        sudo restic-home snapshots
  #        sudo restic-home restore latest --target /tmp/restore \
  #          --include /home/austin/Documents
  #
  # (For proper secret management later, look at sops-nix or agenix; a
  # root-only file outside the store is the simplest sound approach for a
  # single machine.)
